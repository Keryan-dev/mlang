(** In order to handle backends with limited function / method capacity, such as
    Java's 64kB of bytecode per method, class, etc, this funciton allows a
    [program] to be split into chunks of an arbitrary size using the string
    argument as a suffix to the new function / method name. We piggyback on the
    existing rules semantics, with these chunks being rule definitions and
    inserting rule calls in their place*)
